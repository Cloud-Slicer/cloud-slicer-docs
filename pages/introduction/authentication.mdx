Cloud Slicer uses **JWT (JSON Web Token) Bearer authentication** to secure all API endpoints. This ensures that only authorized users can access and interact with your account and 3D printing resources.

## How Authentication Works

1. **Register and log in** to your Cloud Slicer account.
2. **Generate an API token** (JWT) from your dashboard under the "Tokens" tab.
3. **Include the token** in the `Authorization` header of every API request:

   ```http
   Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
   ```

4. The server verifies your token and grants access if it is valid and unexpired.

## What is a JWT?

A **JWT (JSON Web Token)** is a secure, compact way to represent claims between two parties. It is commonly used for authentication and authorization in modern APIs.

A JWT consists of three parts:

1. **Header**: Specifies the signing algorithm and token type.
2. **Payload**: Contains user data and claims (like user ID, email, and expiration time).
3. **Signature**: Verifies that the token has not been tampered with.

A JWT looks like this:

```
<base64url-encoded header>.<base64url-encoded payload>.<base64url-encoded signature>
```

When you authenticate, Cloud Slicer checks the signature and the claims (like expiration) to ensure your token is valid.

## Example: Using Your Token

Here is how you might use your token with `curl`:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" https://api.cloudslicer3d.com/v1/user
```

Or in the API playground, paste your token into the authorization modal (lock icon) to authenticate your session.

:::warning
**Keep your token secret!** Treat it like a passwordâ€”never share it or expose it in public code repositories.
