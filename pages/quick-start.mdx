4. ## Make Your First API Call ##

   Ready to test it out? Try uploading your first STL file:

   1. **Find** the `POST /v1/file` endpoint in the API documentation
   2. **Expand** the tab to reveal the POST request details
   3. **Upload** an STL file using the `choose file` button to open up your file explorer
   4. **Execute** the request POST request

   The response will include a **file ID** that you can use for:

   - **Checking dimensions** and printability
   - **Generating quotes** for automated instant pricing estimates
   - **Managing** the uploaded file to save on your cloud storage

   :::tip
    The `file_id` acts as your key to manage and reference your uploaded files in subsequent API calls.  It is the unique identifier by which all other API calls stem from.
