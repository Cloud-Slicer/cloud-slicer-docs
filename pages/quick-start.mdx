   üéâ **Congratulations!** You're now authenticated and ready to explore the Cloud Slicer API.

4. **Make Your First API Call (Optional)**

   Ready to test it out? Try uploading your first STL file:

   1. **Find** the `POST /v1/file` endpoint in the API documentation
   2. **Expand** the tabe to reveal the post request details
   3. **Upload** an STL file using the `choose file` button to open up your file explorer
   4. **Execute** the request

   The response will include a **file ID** that you can use for:

   - üìè **Checking dimensions** and printability
   - üí∞ **Generating quotes** for 3D printing
   - üìÅ **Downloading** the file later for retrieval

   :::tip
    The `file_id` acts as your key to manage and reference your uploaded files in subsequent API calls.  It is the unique identifier by which all other calls stem from.
